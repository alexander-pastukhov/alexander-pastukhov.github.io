- title: TriDimRegression
  index: 1
  language: R
  description: >
    Package to calculate the bidimensional and tridimensional regression between two 2D/3D configurations. Uses Stan engine to provide posterior distribution of fits. Individual fits can be characterized via Bayesian R2 and compared via widely applicable information criteria (WAIC) or leave-one out cross-validation criteria (LOO).

  index: 2
  language: R
  description: >
    R package to import eye tracking recording generated by SR Research Eyelink eye tracker from EDF-files. It includes options to import events and/or recorded samples and extract individual events such as saccades, fixations, blinks, and recorded variables.

- title: BiDimRegression
  index: 3
  language: R
  description: >
    Package to calculate the bidimensional regression between two 2D configurations following the approach by Tobler (1965). Provides fits and statistics for Eucledian, affine, and projective transformation. Individual fits can be compared via ANOVA.

  index : 4
  language: Matlab
  description: >
    The library provides a simple interface to import contents of the EDF files generated by Eyelink eye-tracker into Matlab. It imports events and/or samples, automatically parsing them into separate trials. In addition to that, several post-processing functions can be used to extract selected events (fixations, saccades and blinks), variable values (TRIAL_VAR events) and microsaccades.
