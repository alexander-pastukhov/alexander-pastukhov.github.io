  description: >
    Estimates cumulative history for time-series for continuously viewed bistable perceptual rivalry displays. Computes cumulative history via a homogeneous first order differential process. I.e., it assumes exponential growth/decay of the history as a function time and perceptually dominant state. Supports Gamma, log normal, and normal distribution families. A package to compute a cumulative history for time-series of perceptual dominance in bistable displays.

    R package to import eye tracking recording generated by SR Research Eyelink eye tracker from EDF-files. It includes options to import events and/or recorded samples and extract individual events such as saccades, fixations, blinks, and recorded variables.

- title: saccadr
  index: 3
  language: R
  description: >
    The package uses an ensemble of methods approach to label individual samples and then applies a majority vote approach to identify saccades. It uses several methods to label individual samples as belonging to a saccade, classifies a sample as a potential saccade if its proportion of votes exceeds a preset threshold, and then identifies saccades based on minimal saccade duration and minimal time between the saccades. Currently, the library implements saccade detection using methods proposed in Engbert and Kliegl (2003), Otero-Millan et al. (2014), and NystrÃ¶m and Holmqvist (2010). For binocular data, 1) samples can be averaged before velocity computation, 2) votes can be merged so that function returns binocular saccades, or 3) saccades are extracted for each eye separately. The package can be extended via custom methods and it also uses a modular approach to compute velocity and acceleration from noisy samples with the possibility of using custom differentiation methods. Finally, you can obtain methods votes per gaze sample instead of saccades.

  index: 4
  language: [R, Stan]
  description: >
    Package to calculate the bidimensional and tridimensional regression between two 2D/3D configurations. Uses Stan engine to provide posterior distribution of fits. Individual fits can be evaluated based on Bayesian R<sup>2</sup> and compared via widely applicable information criteria (WAIC) or leave-one out cross-validation criteria (LOO).

    Package to calculate the bidimensional regression between two 2D configurations following the approach by Tobler (1965). Provides fits and statistics for Eucledian, affine, and projective transformation. Individual fits can be compared via ANOVA.

  index : 6
  language: Matlab
  description: >
    The library provides a simple interface to import contents of the EDF files generated by Eyelink eye-tracker into Matlab. It imports events and/or samples, automatically parsing them into separate trials. In addition to that, several post-processing functions can be used to extract selected events (fixations, saccades and blinks), variable values (TRIAL_VAR events) and microsaccades.
